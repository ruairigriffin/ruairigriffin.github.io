About Me  

-->
<section>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I am a Software Engineer, based in Dunedin, New Zealand currently working for BlueJeans by Verizon. 
I work primarily on the <a href="https://github.com/bluejeans/ios-client-sdk">iOS Client SDK</a> to allow integrators to build communication solutions on top of the BlueJeans platform.
I also work on developing features used by the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluejeans-video-conferencing/id560788314">BlueJeans iOS app</a> and the BlueJeans macOS app.
I strive to provide the best possible developer experience and deliver an ergonomic, full-featured and reliable platform for integrators to build on. 
</p>
<p>
I enjoy solving difficult technical challenges and finding solutions that make complex problems easy to reason about.
My favourite commits are those that remove, rather than add LOC and make explicit, implicit assumptions in the code.
I'm passionate about DX and love finding ways to improve the productivity of myself, my team and our users.
